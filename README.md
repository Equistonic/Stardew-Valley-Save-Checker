## Description
***This is still a work-in-progress and may contain bugs.***
This is a program designed to check the progress of a given save file for the game, Stardew Valley. It is designed to work with save files in all game versions from 1.5 to the most recent. It is written in Python so it is not the fastest program. See [Code Prerequisites](#code-prerequisites) for required Python packages and other dependencies.
